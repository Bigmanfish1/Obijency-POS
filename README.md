# Business Automater
This was my final PAT Project for grade 12 where we had to build a real use case application using java and swing components in order to solve a real world problem.
## Project Overview
The Business-automater is software used by small businesses with a lack of computer processing in the daily operations of their business. Most small business owners are used to traditional ways of managing stock and calculating gross profit, but my program is going to show them how efficient and convenient it would be to adopt POS software for their business. The software helps in the retail industry which is very transaction intensive. The Business-automater helps businesses with transaction processing in the sense that it helps them to record all transactions input into the system using a barcode code scanner or manual input. The software also has some backend features that help with some accounting aspects of the business such as automatically calculating profits for each month based on the cost and selling price of various products. The software will also allow owners to keep track of debtors that owe the business. Another backend features the software has is stock management in the sense that the owner would be able to add new products to the system, get low stock alerts, see stock levels, and deduct stock as transactions take place. With the help of the Business automater small business owners would optimize their business operations to run at peak efficiency by moving from traditional methods of using notebooks to record and manage products and transactions to a more digital approach that would be user friendly and would allow business owners to view transaction history and would renew the transaction record for each month automatically.
